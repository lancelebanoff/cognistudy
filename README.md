# Cognistudy

CogniStudy creates a fun and social way for high school students to prepare for the SAT and ACT.  While there are many resources available to students looking to prepare for these tests, none of todayâ€™s options offer the combination of social interactivity, tutor support, progress tracking, and entertainment that we provide.

CogniStudy will consist of two separate interfaces, a web interface for tutors, and an Android application for students.  The Android application allows students to answer practice SAT and ACT questions in one of two modes- practice or challenge.  In practice mode, the focus is simply on answering practice questions and improving your knowledge and score.  In challenge mode, students can play against either a friend, random opponent, or computer and take turns playing a battleship-style game between rounds of questions.  For the game, the classic battleships are replaced with funny study items with personality and special abilities.  After each round of questions, players can shoot locations on the board and use special abilities based on the number of correct answers.

The Android app will allow people to connect through Facebook, play games and message each other, view profiles and achievements, and buy power-ups with in-game currency.  Also, students are able to bookmark previously answered questions and view analytics. Additionally, tutors can interact with students by messaging them and sending them questions for practice.
